- 👀 I’m interested in plotting dynagmic area preserving maps using Henon's equation and others such as Hamilton equations.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to plot graphs using Python and C
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on understanding the math behind all of this. I have written a program that allows to tinker
- the physical parameters of the equations and have many new features planned.
